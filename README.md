Features

1. CNN Architecture: Utilizes Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout layers for feature extraction and regularization.
2. Data Preprocessing: Normalization of pixel values and reshaping of input data.
3. Training and Evaluation: Model training on the training set, evaluation on the validation set, and prediction on the test set.
4. Submission: Generates predictions formatted for submission to Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition.
